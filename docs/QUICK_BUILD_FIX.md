# Quick Build Failure Fix for SoloCreatorHub AI

If you're seeing a generic "Build failed. Check the terminal for details" error, follow these steps to quickly resolve the issue:

## Immediate Actions

1. **Check the build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Fix the most common issues** based on those error messages

## Common Quick Fixes

### 1. Missing React-Toastify

If your build logs mention React-Toastify:

```bash
npm install react-toastify
```

Then update your package.json:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "react-toastify": "^9.1.3"
}
```

### 2. TypeScript Errors

If you see TypeScript compilation errors:

1. Create a `tsconfig.build.json` file:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.test.ts", "**/*.test.tsx"]
}
```

2. Update your build script in package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json && vite build"
}
```

### 3. Environment Variables

If environment variables are missing:

1. Create a `.env.production` file with all required variables (without sensitive values):

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
MYSQL_HOST=your-mysql-host
MYSQL_USER=your-mysql-user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-mysql-password
MYSQL_DATABASE=solocreatorhub
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

2. Make sure your deployment platform has these environment variables configured

### 4. Node Version Issues

If you're seeing syntax errors or unexpected token errors:

1. Create a `.nvmrc` file:

```
16
```

2. For AWS Amplify, update the build settings to use Node 16:

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm use 16
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:
      - '**/*'
```

### 5. Memory Issues

If the build is running out of memory:

1. Update your build script in package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/vite build"
}
```

### 6. Dependency Conflicts

If you're seeing dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Commit the updated package-lock.json
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update package-lock.json to fix dependency conflicts"
git push
```

## Specific Fix for SoloCreatorHub AI

Based on your current setup, the most likely issue is with React-Toastify. Your main.tsx imports it, but it's not in your package.json:

```bash
npm install react-toastify
```

Then update your package.json:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "axios": "^1.4.0",
  "chart.js": "^4.3.0",
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.14.1",
  "react-toastify": "^9.1.3",
  "zustand": "^4.3.9"
}
```

## After Fixing

1. Commit and push your changes
2. Redeploy your application
3. Check the build logs again to ensure the issue is resolved
